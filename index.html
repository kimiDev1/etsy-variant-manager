      <h2>About the Application</h2>
      <p>
        Variant Manager is a personal project currently under development, created for 
        learning purposes and private use by the developer. The main goal of the application 
        is to explore how the Etsy API can be used to manage complex product variations—such 
        as apparel sizes, colors, and SKUs—more efficiently than the standard Etsy interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is not publicly available and is intended only to work with the
        developer’s own Etsy shop data during development and testing.

      <h2>Purpose of API Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The Etsy API will be used strictly for development, testing, and personal
        productivity purposes. The application will only access the developer’s own
        Etsy shop data and will not be made available to the public or commercialized
        at this stage. All usage will comply with Etsy’s API terms and policies.
